# hori-seo-n-site-update
This is the first challenge, clean up and improve HTML and CSS without changing functionality, 
AS A SIDE NOTE: I began amending this project from my desk top prior to making a repository on GITHUB.
I attempted to go back and make a repository and then pull the content, but due to the fact that I'd already amended and saved the project, it only showed a post amended project.
Yes, in hindsite, I could have uploaded the content again and started from the beginning... but I wasn't aware that the run-buddy project was not graded, and had focused much of my time on that (and I'm so far in, I'd like to finish it for my portfolio) that I didn't want to not at least have a finished product to show my fake clients... because, at the end of the day, that's what they want to see, right? :)
